## Project Overview

Compilator is a C++ compiler that aims to provide correctness, efficiency, and compatibility with a wide range of C++ language features. The project is divided into several components, including the Lexer, Parser, Semantic Analyzer, and Code Generator.

- **Lexer:** The lexical analyzer responsible for tokenizing the source code. [Learn more](docs/lexer/overview.md).

- **Parser:** The syntax analyzer that constructs the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from the tokenized code.

- **Semantic Analyzer:** The component that performs semantic analysis, including type checking and scope resolution.

- **Code Generator:** The module responsible for generating target code (e.g., assembly or machine code).

Compilator is an open-source project, and we welcome contributions from the community. Please refer to the [Contributing Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for details on how to get involved.
