# C++ Compiler Overview

## Introduction

Welcome to the documentation for the C++ Compiler project. This document serves as a high-level overview of the compiler, its goals, and its key components. Whether you're a contributor, user, or simply curious about the project, this overview will help you understand what this compiler is all about.

## Project Goals

The primary goal of this C++ Compiler project is to create a functional and efficient compiler for the C++ programming language. It aims to provide the following:

- **Correctness:** Ensuring that the generated code behaves according to the C++ language standard.
- **Efficiency:** Generating optimized machine code for target architectures.
- **Compatibility:** Supporting a wide range of C++ language features and constructs.
- **Usability:** Providing a user-friendly interface and clear documentation.

## Key Components

The C++ Compiler consists of several key components, each responsible for specific aspects of the compilation process:

1. **Lexer (Lexical Analyzer):** This component tokenizes the source code, breaking it down into smaller units called tokens. It handles keywords, identifiers, literals, and comments.

2. **Parser (Syntax Analyzer):** The parser analyzes the syntactic structure of the source code and builds an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST). It checks for correct language constructs and their arrangement.

3. **Semantic Analyzer:** This component performs semantic analysis, ensuring that the code adheres to the C++ language rules. It includes type checking, scope resolution, and other high-level checks.

4. **Intermediate Code Generator:** The intermediate code generator produces an intermediate representation of the code, which is later used for optimization and code generation.

5. **Optimizer:** The optimizer applies various optimization techniques to improve the efficiency of the generated code. It includes constant folding, dead code elimination, and more.

6. **Code Generator:** The code generator generates target code (e.g., assembly or machine code) from the intermediate representation. It aims to produce efficient and correct code for the target architecture.
