# Lexer Overview

## Introduction

The Lexer, also known as the Lexical Analyzer, is a vital component of our compiler project. Its primary responsibility is to transform the source code written in our target language (e.g., C++, Rust) into a sequence of smaller, meaningful units called tokens. These tokens serve as the input for subsequent phases of the compiler, such as parsing and semantic analysis.

## Purpose

The Lexer plays a crucial role in the compilation process by:

- **Tokenization:** Identifying and categorizing language constructs, including keywords, identifiers, literals, operators, and more.
- **Whitespace and Comment Handling:** Removing non-essential characters like whitespace and comments from the source code.
- **Error Reporting:** Detecting and reporting lexical errors or invalid tokens to help users write correct code.

## Design Philosophy

Our Lexer is designed with a focus on efficiency, accuracy, and extensibility. Key design considerations include:

- **Modular Architecture:** The Lexer is structured as a standalone module, making it easy to integrate into our compiler project.
- **Regular Expressions:** We use regular expressions to define token patterns, providing flexibility and ease of maintenance.
- **Error Recovery:** The Lexer is designed to recover gracefully from lexical errors and continue processing the source code.

## Tokenization Rules

Our Lexer follows a set of predefined tokenization rules, which define how the source code is broken down into tokens. These rules cover various language constructs, including:

- **Keywords:** Recognizing reserved words like `if`, `while`, and `return`.
- **Identifiers:** Identifying user-defined names for variables, functions, and more.
- **Literals:** Handling constants such as integers, floating-point numbers, and string literals.
- **Operators:** Recognizing operators like `+`, `-`, `=`, and more.
- **Comments:** Stripping comments (both single-line and multi-line) from the source code.

## Usage

To use the Lexer effectively in your compiler project, follow these steps:

1. **Initialization:** Initialize the Lexer module with the source code to be tokenized.
2. **Token Retrieval:** Retrieve tokens from the Lexer one at a time using appropriate functions or methods.
3. **Token Processing:** Process each token as needed for your specific compiler phase (e.g., parsing, semantic analysis).

For detailed usage instructions and code examples, refer to the [Lexer Usage Guide](usage.md).
